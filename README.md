# GitHub Plus

A Google Chrome extension that adds extra features to GitHub.com

## Features

* Show messages from status.github.com if GitHub is having any availability issues
* Warn when a repo has not been updated in over 6 months
* Show the current testing status from Travis CI
* Add Dashboard links (Issues, Pulls and Stars) to header nav and remove Blog and Help

## Development

Source hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/andrew/github-plus).
Report Issues/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/andrew/github-plus/issues).

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Add documentation if necessary.
 * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
